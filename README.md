# Face Recognition Models

This repository contains pre-trained models for face recognition tasks. The models included in this repository are:

- Haar Cascade Model: A model based on the Haar-like features for object detection, commonly used for face detection tasks.
- PCA Model: A model based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for face recognition and feature extraction.
- Trained Gender Detection Model: A model trained specifically for gender detection from facial images.

## Models

### Haar Cascade Model

The Haar Cascade model is a machine learning-based approach for object detection. It utilizes Haar-like features and a cascade classifier to identify objects in images. In this repository, you can find the pre-trained Haar Cascade model specifically designed for face detection.

### PCA Model

The PCA model is a popular technique for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction. It can be used effectively for face recognition tasks. The pre-trained PCA model provided in this repository enables you to extract facial features and perform face recognition tasks.

### Trained Gender Detection Model

The trained Gender Detection model included in this repository is designed to classify the gender of individuals based on facial images. It has been trained on a labeled dataset and can be used to identify the gender of faces in images or videos.

## Usage

To use the models in your projects, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-recognition-model.git


2. Access the desired model files, which are stored in separate directories.

3. Integrate the chosen model into your code or application as per your requirements
